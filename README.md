Title: Credit Card Fraud Detection 


Overview: This project aims to detect credit card fraud using machine learning techniques, specifically leveraging the Logistic Regression model. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle.
In this project, we have employed the Logistic Regression algorithm to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent based on various attributes present in the dataset.

Environment: The development environment for this project is Google Colaboratory, a cloud-based platform that provides free access to resources like GPUs, making it ideal for training machine learning models.
